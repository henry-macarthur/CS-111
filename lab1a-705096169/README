lab1a.c 
    -> this includes the code for my program

    -> make dist //build tarball
lab1a 
    -> executable generated by running make 
    -> compile with no flags -> echo mode
    -> compile with --shell to open /bin/bash and run commands in it

    -> ^D close writing pipes to program then exit

lab1a-705096169.tar.gz
    -> unzip to get all of the files in this project

For research I primarily used the man pages recomended and linked in the project
guide

The GNU C library also had a lot of really good examples for system calls and 
functionality required in this project : https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/
    ->used this for terminos, setting and restoring terminal modes
    ->used this for polling as well

For forking and piping i found the following Geeks for Geeks article very helpful

Contains:
	Makefile: default builds both of the following targets, clean, and distinct that builds the tarball

	lab4c_tcp.c: this has the beagle bone connect to a given server and port over a TCP connection. Communicates by sending
		current temps and takes command input to change time, temp readings, start, stop, etc

	lab4c_tls.c: this has the beagle bone connect to a given server and port over a TCP connection and uses tls 
		 for secure communication between the client and the server. Communicates by sending
		current temps and takes command input to change time, temp readings, start, stop, etc
	README

Both of the c files allow a user to specify period, scale, id, host, and a log option, and a port number

On connection, both of these send an initial connection message of the student ID passed in, and then sends data over to the server and 
gets server data and processes it. To stop the program, send SHUTDOWN.

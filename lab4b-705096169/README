lab4b.c
	this contains the implementation of the project spec.
	It reads data from the temp sensor, and outputs it to
	stdin and log file if specified. It allows a user to specify
	the period, logfile, and temp scale at execution time.
	Durring run time. a user can change the temp scale, the sample
	period, log messages, start and stop data sampling, and turn off
	the program.

Makefile:
	default: builds .c into lab4 executable
	clean: remove the temporary files creates
	check: run the smoke test

SmokeTest.sh:
	shell script that tests basic functionality of the program.
	Tests to make sure one can enter commands at execution and
	run-time. Makes sure that logging of data and commands to stdout and
	log files is correct. Checks proper exit codes with successful and
	unsuccessful runs.
